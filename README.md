# SillyTavern-Not-A-Discord-Theme

Simple extension without anything, only adds css to ST page, to simplify updates (I'm thinking/working on theme manager extension)

You will need:

1. https://github.com/LenAnderson/SillyTavern-CssSnippets if
2. Turn off other themes
3. Install theme extension https://github.com/IceFog72/SillyTavern-Not-A-Discord-Theme
4. Reload page
5. Select Not a Discord Theme as UI Theme for colors

What I recommended to have too:

- https://github.com/LenAnderson/SillyTavern-WorldInfoDrawer
- https://github.com/SillyTavern/Extension-TopInfoBar
- https://github.com/LenAnderson/SillyTavern-CssSnippets

if you are using QuickReplies:

- https://github.com/IceFog72/SillyTavern-SimpleQRBarToggle
- https://github.com/LenAnderson/SillyTavern-QuickRepliesDrawer

Additional Info:

For better quality of char img in chat, you need to edit config.yaml -> thumbnails:

enabled: false

Caution for people with thousands of chars! It will make all their image load in full size in Character List Panel!
